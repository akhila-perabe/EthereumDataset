# EthereumDataset

This project is to analyze the ethereum dataset for BAT (Basic Attention Token). BAT radically improves the efficiency of digital advertising by creating a new token that can be exchanged between publishers, advertisers, and users. It all happens on the Ethereum blockchain.The token can be used to obtain a variety of advertising and attention-based services on the BAT platform. The utility of the token is based on user attention, which simply means a personâ€™s focused mental engagement.Its total supply is 1,500,000,000 and has decimal count of 18.




The purpose of this project is to:

1. Understand the buy and sell distribution of tokens
2. Analyze the features/correlations in different layers of token transactions. Layers here is based on token amount.
3. Create a linear regression model to predict the price return of a day based on the features of the previous day.
